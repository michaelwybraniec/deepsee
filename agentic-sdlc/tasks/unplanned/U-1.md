# Task ID: U-1
# Title: Prometheus + Grafana observability dashboards
# Status: [x] Completed
# Priority: medium
# Owner: Backend Dev
# Estimated Effort: 1.5-2h

## Description
Set up Prometheus and Grafana to visualize the metrics exposed by the Task Tracker API. This provides a production-ready observability stack for monitoring system health and performance.

## Dependencies
- [x] Task ID: 9.3 (Metrics collection must be implemented)

## Requirements
1. **Prometheus Setup**:
   - Create `prometheus.yml` configuration file
   - Configure scrape job for `/api/metrics` endpoint
   - Set appropriate scrape interval (e.g., 15s)
   - Configure retention policy

2. **Grafana Setup**:
   - Add Grafana to docker-compose or provide standalone setup instructions
   - Configure Prometheus as data source
   - Create dashboard with must-have panels:
     - **Request Volume**: Requests per second from `http_requests_total`
     - **Error Rate**: Percentage of errors from `http_errors_total` / `http_requests_total`
     - **Latency**: p50 and p95 percentiles from `http_request_duration_seconds`
     - **Reminders Processed**: Success/failure counts from `reminders_processed_total`

3. **Documentation**:
   - Document how to start Prometheus and Grafana
   - Explain dashboard panels and their purpose
   - Provide basic troubleshooting guide

## Implementation Steps
1. Create `prometheus.yml` with scrape config for API metrics endpoint
2. Add Prometheus service to docker-compose (or provide standalone instructions)
3. Add Grafana service to docker-compose (or provide standalone instructions)
4. Configure Grafana data source (Prometheus)
5. Create Grafana dashboard JSON with must-have panels
6. Document setup and usage in `backend/docs/monitoring-usage.md` or separate guide
7. Test that metrics are being scraped and displayed correctly

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Prometheus is configured to scrape `/api/metrics` endpoint
- [x] Grafana is configured with Prometheus as data source
- [x] Dashboard includes all must-have panels (request volume, error rate, latency, reminders)
- [x] Dashboard panels display data correctly
- [x] Documentation explains how to start and use Prometheus/Grafana
- [x] Setup works with docker-compose or standalone instructions provided

## Notes
This task extends Task 9 (Monitoring, logging, health checks) by providing visualization tools. The metrics are already exposed at `/api/metrics`; this task adds the infrastructure to visualize them.
