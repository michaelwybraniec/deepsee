# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project environment and documentation
# Status: [x] Completed
# Priority: high
# Owner: Full Stack Dev
# Estimated Effort: 4h

## Description
Set up the Task Tracker repository structure and core documentation so that requirements and architecture are clearly captured before implementation.

## Dependencies
- None

## Testing Instructions
- Open `README.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/technical-specs.md`, and `docs/architecture.md` and verify they are present and readable.
- Confirm the backend and frontend directories exist.

## Security Review
- Ensure the repository does not contain secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens).

## Risk Assessment
- If documentation is incomplete or inaccurate, later implementation may drift from the original assignment requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `README.md` explains project purpose and links to all docs in `docs/`.
- [x] `docs/requirements.md` contains the original assignment text.
- [x] `docs/technical-specs.md` restates requirements in a structured way without changing scope.
- [x] `docs/architecture.md` describes the planned architecture and marks design choices clearly.
- [x] `backend/` and `frontend/` directories exist with placeholder READMEs.

## Definition of Done
- [x] All required documentation files exist and are committed.
- [x] Docs have been quickly reviewed for alignment with the assignment.
- [x] Repo structure (root + backend + frontend + docs) is in place.
- [x] No obvious secrets in the repo.
- [x] All acceptance criteria met.

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: All referenced docs open without errors; directories exist.
- **Observable Outcomes**: New contributors can understand the assignment and architecture by reading the docs.

## Notes
This task is largely complete in the current state of the repository but should be checked once before starting development.

**Verification completed**: All acceptance criteria verified on review:
- README.md properly links to all documentation files
- requirements.md contains original assignment text (starts with "Hi Michael...")
- technical-specs.md is a structured restatement without scope changes
- architecture.md describes architecture with "Design Choice" markers
- backend/ and frontend/ directories exist with README files
- Repository structure verified: backend/, frontend/, docs/, agentic-sdlc/ all present

## Strengths
Provides a clear, shared understanding of scope and architecture for both humans and AI tools.
