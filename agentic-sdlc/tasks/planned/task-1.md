# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project environment and documentation
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Full Stack Dev
# Estimated Effort: 4h

## Description
Set up the Task Tracker repository structure and core documentation so that requirements and architecture are clearly captured before implementation.

## Dependencies
- None

## Testing Instructions
- Open `README.md`, `docs/requirements.md`, `docs/technical-specs.md`, and `docs/architecture.md` and verify they are present and readable.
- Confirm the backend and frontend directories exist.

## Security Review
- Ensure the repository does not contain secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens).

## Risk Assessment
- If documentation is incomplete or inaccurate, later implementation may drift from the original assignment requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `README.md` explains project purpose and links to all docs in `docs/`.
- [ ] `docs/requirements.md` contains the original assignment text.
- [ ] `docs/technical-specs.md` restates requirements in a structured way without changing scope.
- [ ] `docs/architecture.md` describes the planned architecture and marks design choices clearly.
- [ ] `backend/` and `frontend/` directories exist with placeholder READMEs.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All required documentation files exist and are committed.
- [ ] Docs have been quickly reviewed for alignment with the assignment.
- [ ] Repo structure (root + backend + frontend + docs) is in place.
- [ ] No obvious secrets in the repo.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: All referenced docs open without errors; directories exist.
- **Observable Outcomes**: New contributors can understand the assignment and architecture by reading the docs.

## Notes
This task is largely complete in the current state of the repository but should be checked once before starting development.

## Strengths
Provides a clear, shared understanding of scope and architecture for both humans and AI tools.
