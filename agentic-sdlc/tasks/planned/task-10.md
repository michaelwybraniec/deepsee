## Description
Implement the React (or similar) frontend UI for login and task management, including task list, task detail, create/edit task views, attachments section, change password, and toasts/alerts for success and failure with client-side validation.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 2
- [ ] Task ID: 3
- [ ] Task ID: 4
- [ ] Task ID: 5

## Testing Instructions
- UI smoke tests for:
  - Login and change password.
  - Viewing task list and detail.
  - Creating and editing tasks.
  - Managing attachments from the UI.
  - Basic validation and error display.

## Security Review
- Ensure frontend does not expose sensitive information and handles tokens securely.

## Risk Assessment
- Poor UX or validation can make the app hard to use and hide backend errors.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Login and change password pages implemented and wired to backend.
- [ ] Task list, detail, and create/edit views implemented.
- [ ] Attachments section implemented (upload, list, delete).
- [ ] Client-side validation implemented with user-friendly error messages.
- [ ] Toasts/alerts shown for success and failure of key actions.
- [ ] Basic UI smoke tests are passing.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Frontend communicates successfully with the backend API for all required flows.
- [ ] Core views exist and are navigable.
- [ ] Validation and error handling implemented.
- [ ] Smoke tests implemented and passing.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met.

## Measurable Outcomes
- **Verification Criteria**: UI smoke tests pass; core flows can be demonstrated end-to-end.

## Notes
Styling and component library choices are design decisions; the requirement is to provide the specified views and behavior.

## Strengths
Delivers the visible user-facing functionality required in the assignment.
